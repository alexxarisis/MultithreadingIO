# Multithreading IO

### *University Project*
---

Implemented multithreaded IO operations in the [kiwi OS](https://github.com/aejsmith/kiwi).

* Enabled support for parallel reads and single write operations.

* Through use of threads and mutex locks.

The changes took place in a part of the Kiwi OS, its storage system.

All the changes are recorded in the `Edited Files` directory.

An explanation of the changes is recorded in `Report.pdf`, but it is written in Greek.

*Although, it also contains the results of the test runs in screenshots.*
